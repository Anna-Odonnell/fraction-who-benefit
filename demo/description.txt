##Since the MISTIE II data is not publicly available, we simulate a dataset and
do a similar analysis as we did for MISTIE II using the simulated dataset. The
simulated dataset is provided in this folder, so that readers can run the analysis
themselves. Results of the analysis are provided in Appendix O of the Supplementary
Materials. 



##In generateDataset.R, we generate the simulated dataset and save it as
“simulatedDataset.Rdata”.
##The simulated dataset is then analyzed in “analyzeDataset.R”. The analysis
includes computing bound estimates and constructing m-out-of-n CI’s for the
bound parameters using the simulated dataset.
