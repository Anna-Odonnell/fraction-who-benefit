##All code in boundFunctions.R assumes an ordinal outcome, where the higher the level, the better the outcome.

#############################################################################
boundsNoCov_res estimates the lower and upper bounds on the fraction who benefit, without a baseline variable but allowing support restrictions applying to the entire population

The inputs are as follows:
##YT is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment
##YC is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control
##maxBen is the maximum possible benefit (i.e., YT - YC <= maxBen)
##maxHarm is the maximum possible harm (i.e., YC - YT <= maxHarm)

Note: if the user does not wish to make any support restrictions, set
##maxBen and maxHarm as a number beyond the range of the ordinal scale 

The outputs are as follows:
##lb is the lower bound estimate
##ub is the upper bound estimate
##eps is the epsilon relaxation term

##boundsCov_res estimates the lower and upper bounds on the fraction who benefit, with a baseline variable having two possible values (x1 and x2), and
support restrictions applying to the entire population.

The inputs are as follows:
##YT1 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment and in Subpopulation 1
##YC1 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control and in Subpopulation 1
##YT2 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment and in Subpopulation 2
##YC2 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control and in Subpopulation 2
##maxBen is the maximum possible benefit (i.e., YT - YC <= maxBen)
##maxHarm is the maximum possible harm (i.e., YC - YT <= maxHarm)

Note: if the user does not wish to make any support restrictions, set
##maxBen and maxHarm as a number beyond the range of the ordinal scale 

The outputs are as follows:
##lb is the lower bound estimate
##ub is the upper bound estimate
##x1 is the vector including the lower bound estimate, upper bound estimate, and epsilon relaxation term for Subpopulation 1.
##x2 is the vector including the lower bound estimate, upper bound estimate, and epsilon relaxation term for Subpopulation 2.
