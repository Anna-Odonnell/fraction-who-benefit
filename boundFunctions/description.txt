##All code in boundFunctions.R assumes an ordinal outcome, where higher levels correspond to better outcomes.

boundsNoCov_res estimates the lower and upper bounds that do not incorporate a baseline variable but may incorporate support restrictions applying to the entire population.

The inputs are as follows:
##YT is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment (with NA’s removed)
##YC is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control (with NA’s removed)
##maxBen is the maximum possible benefit (i.e., YT - YC <= maxBen)
##maxHarm is the maximum possible harm (i.e., YC - YT <= maxHarm)

Note: if the user does not wish to make any support restrictions, set
##maxBen and maxHarm as a number beyond the range of the ordinal scale 

The outputs are as follows:
##lb is the lower bound estimate
##ub is the upper bound estimate
##eps is the epsilon relaxation term


##boundsCov_res estimates the lower and upper bounds that incorporate a baseline variable having two possible values (x1 and x2), and that may incorporate support restrictions applying to the entire population.

The inputs are as follows:
##YT1 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment and in Subpopulation 1 (with NA’s removed)
##YC1 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control and in Subpopulation 1 (with NA’s removed)
##YT2 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to treatment and in Subpopulation 2 (with NA’s removed)
##YC2 is the vector of outcomes for those assigned to control and in Subpopulation 2 (with NA’s removed)
##maxBen is the maximum possible benefit (i.e., YT - YC <= maxBen)
##maxHarm is the maximum possible harm (i.e., YC - YT <= maxHarm)

Note: if the user does not wish to make any support restrictions, set
maxBen and maxHarm as a number beyond the range of the ordinal scale 

The outputs are as follows:
##lb is the lower bound estimate for the population
##ub is the upper bound estimate for the population
##x1 is the vector including the lower bound estimate, upper bound estimate, and epsilon relaxation term for Subpopulation 1 (in that order).
##x2 is the vector including the lower bound estimate, upper bound estimate, and epsilon relaxation term for Subpopulation 2 (in that order).

The mOfn.R code includes two functions that are used to construct a CI for
a bound parameter using m-out-of-n bootstrap. The use of these functions is 
demonstrated in the “analyzeDataset.R” file in the “demo” folder.
