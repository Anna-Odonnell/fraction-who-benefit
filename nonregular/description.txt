The code in this folder corresponds to the non-regular discussion in Section 4.3 of our paper. We give a setting where the estimator is non-regular. Non-regularity in this setting is proved in the Supplementary Materials for our paper. In addition, simulations are conducted to confirm the results. 

The code for the simulations is in the files entitled P0.R and Pn.R. The output of P0.R is distributions_P0.Rdata. The output of Pn.R is distributions_Pn.Rdata. 

We generate plots of the results using the code nonregularPlot_SuppMat.R. The plots are printed in the pdf file nonregularPlot_SuppMat.pdf, and they can also be found in the Supplementary Materials corresponding to our paper.
