The code in this folder is for the MISTIE Application section.

mRS30.R and mRS180.R are for 30-day mRS score and 180-day mRS score, respectively. In these files, the bound estimates are computed and the marginal distributions (with and without stratifying by the baseline variable) are plotted. 

RICV_bounds.R and RICV_margDist.R are for reduction in clot volume (RICV). In RICV_bounds.R, we compute the bound estimates for RICV2, RICV5, RICV10, and RICV20. In RICV_margDist.R, we plot the marginal distributions (with and without stratifying by the baseline variable) for RICV2, RICV5, RICV10, and RICV20.

In the Excel file, the bound estimates are plotted for the different outcomes.
