The content in this folder is for the simulation studies (without baseline variable) described in Section 6.

The CI_mofn and CI_nbootstrap subfolders include the R code for implementing the simulations. The results are saved as .Rdata files in these subfolders. 

The allResults subfolder has all of the results in one place. The code Table1.R for making Table 1 of the paper is also here. In addition, the file pluginEstimator_binaryNoHarm.R computes the bias and standard error of the plug-in estimator in the binary (no harm) case.
