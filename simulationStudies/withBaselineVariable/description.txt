The contents in this folder are for running and tabulating the results of the simulation studies with a baseline variable, described in the Simulation Studies section and Supplementary Materials of the paper.

There are two sets of simulation studies, one set with outcome 180-day mRS (see subfolder mRS180_BV) and the other set with outcome RICV5 (see subfolder RICV5_BV).

Within each subfolder, there is a folder called boundParameters and another folder called estimator. The contents of the boundParameters folder are run first. There, we get the marginal distributions of the outcome under control and treatment for each stratum and the probability of each stratum; this is done for each of the three stratifications of the baseline variable described in the Supplementary Materials of the paper. The contents of the estimator folder are run next. They include the code for running the simulations (i.e., simulating 10,000 randomized trials of sample size n and computing the estimated bounds on the fraction who benefit, using the stratification of the baseline variable specified by the title of the code). It also has code for generating LaTeX tables of the bias/standard error of the estimator. These tables can be found in the Supplementary Tables of the paper.
