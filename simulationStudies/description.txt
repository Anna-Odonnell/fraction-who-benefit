The code contained in this folder is for the simulation studies described in Section 6 of the paper.

In the CI_mofn and CI_nbootstrap subfolders, there are .R files. Each .R file includes code for simulating a single trial and calculating bound estimates/CI’s using it. The title of the .R file gives the context. 

	For example: For binary_noHarm_N100.R, the outcome is the binary 	outcome described in Section 6, and the trial size is n = 100. The 	goal is inference about the lower and upper bounds on the fraction 	who benefit, assuming no harm. 

The .R files in the CI_mofn folder construct the CI’s for the lower and upper bounds using m-out-of-n bootstrap. The .R files in the CI_nbootstrap folder construct the CI’s using n bootstrap.

Each .R file was run 10,000 times to simulate 10,000 trials for each context. The seeds were set to be 1-10,000.

The results are given in the .Rdata files. The title of the .Rdata file specifies the context that those results correspond to.

Finally, the R file entitled Table1.R uses these .Rdata files to create Table 1 of the paper.
